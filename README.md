# LDS Scripture Podcast with Daily Downloads
This provides a method to integrate scripture audio doanloaded from [lds.org](lds.org/scriptures) into a podcast feed. Currently 
supports Book of Mormon, but there is no barrier to supporting all of the standard works.

## Adding to your podcast feed
Point your podcast to the rss feed located at:
`https://raw.githubusercontent/sputnick1124/scripture-podcasts/rss/book-of-mormon.rss`
and it should behave just like a normal podcast.
